## FAQ

**Q: Can I use third-party libraries for features?**  
A: Yes, you have absolute freedom in using any libraries and packages.

**Q: What if I find unclear instructions or edge cases?**  
A: Make reasonable assumptions and explain them briefly in a comment or in this README.

**Q: Can I use AI tools during this test?**  
A: We encourage the use of AI tools during development in our daily business.  
Here, we would like to see how you operate and find solutions.  
If you use AI tools, briefly explain where and how, so we can assess your development process.

**Q: The estimated times seem tight. What if I cannot finish everything in 120 minutes?**  
A: We do not require you to finish all tasks 100%.  
We want to get a good grasp of how you operate in somewhat realistic scenarios under a limited time.

**Q: I have trouble with the tasks or boilerplate provided with the test.**  
A: For any questions or issues, you can contact Julian Laudan directly at **julian@sensofusion.com**

**Q: In which order should I do the tasks?**  
A: Tasks are to be done in chronological order, as we rely on previously created components in each task.
